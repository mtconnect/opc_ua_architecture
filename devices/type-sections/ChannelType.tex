An MTConnect \texttt{Channel} is a single data stream associated with a sensor. Each stream
of data can be calibrated separately and allows for the specification of the meta information
and descriptive information. The only required property of the \texttt{Channel} is the number
which is the unique identifier.

The channels will be created by the \texttt{SensorChannelObjectFactory} that composes the \texttt{BrowseName} 
and the \texttt{NodeId} for each object. (See section \ref{type:SensorChannelObjectFactory}).
