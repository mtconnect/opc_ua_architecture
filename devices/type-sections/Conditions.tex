The \mtmodel{CONDITION} \gls{MTDataItem} \gls{category} in MTConnect is the mechanism for reporting alarms on the machine classified by \mtmodel{type} and \mtmodel{subType}--such as an overload of a motor or high temperature or a collection of system level warnings or faults.

In MTConnect, the \gls{MTCondition} provides the meta-data describing the \mtmodel{type}, \mtmodel{subType}, and other properties required by the MTConnect \gls{MTDataItem}. In response to a \gls{sample} request, the \glspl{MTCondition} behaves like an event stream. In response to a \gls{current}, all active conditions are reported, even if there are multiple active conditions for a given type. Usually, an \gls{MTEvent} can only have one state at a time; the \gls{MTCondition} is different and can have multiple states and values, as in the case where there are multiple system alarms for a component.

The set of active \gls{MTCondition} instances are represented in the OPC UA model as \uamodel{Events} and utilize the \uamodel{Active} and \uamodel{Retain} attributes to indicate if they are currently of interest. Details are provided in Section~\ref{sec:mapping-conditions}.

The documentation for the condition behavior in MTConnect can be found in Section 5.7 and 5.8 of \cite{MTCPart3} and an overview in \cite{MTCPart2}.

The MTConnect Data Item with Category of \mtmodel{CONDITION} are mapped to the OPC UA \glspl{ConditionType} in \cite{UAPart9} with a \uamodel{TwoStateVariableType} that represents the current state of all active \mtmodel{Condition}.
