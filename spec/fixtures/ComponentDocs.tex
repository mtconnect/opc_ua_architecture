The base \gls{MTComponent} Type from which all MTConnect Components are derived.
The component types will be created once for all \gls{MTComponent} \glspl{Object}
of that type based on the \gls{QName} of the MTConnect XML element. 

The Component Objects will be created and inserted into the \mtmodel{Components} 
folder with a \gls{BrowseName} of the Component \gls{QName} and the \mtmodel{name} element if specified surrounded 
by square brackets, \texttt{[]}. For example if the MTConnect Element is:

\xml{<Linear name='X'>...</...>}

The OPC UA Object with \gls{BrowseName} \xml{Linear[X]} will be created with the \uamodel{HasTypeDefinition}
referencing the \mtmodel{Linear} OPC UA \gls{Type}. 

The meta data for the component and its relationships are static. The dynamic data will be 
represented using the \cite{UAPart8}.
